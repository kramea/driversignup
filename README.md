# Driver Signup Analysis for a Ride sharing Company

This is a synthetic dataset for ridesharing that shows the details of driver sign-up data. The data consists of when the drivers signed up, the city, sign-up OS, sign-up channel (paid, referred, etc.). Once they signed up for the driving, they are requested to be available for background check, add their vehicle and once those stages are cleared, they are then allowed to start picking up passengers.

Here, the company wants to maximize the trips taken by the drivers. There may be several hurdles before first trip is taken, such as, the background check may be negative, or the drivers may fail to add their vehicle, and so on. This data analysis will try to find the important factors that is involved in the first trip taken by the drivers. And consequently, some recommendations are suggested based on the analysis.
